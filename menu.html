                <img src="/Images/Classic-waffle.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Our signature Classic Belgian Waffle is a golden-brown masterpiece of culinary perfection. Made from
                    a traditional recipe that's been perfected over generations, each waffle features a crispy, golden
                    exterior that gives way to a light, fluffy interior. The deep pockets are specifically designed to
                    capture every drop of pure maple syrup or melted butter. Dusted with a delicate layer of powdered
                    sugar, this timeless breakfast favorite delivers the perfect balance of sweetness and warmth in
                    every bite. Whether enjoyed plain in its pure form or dressed up with fresh berries and whipped
                    cream, our Classic Belgian Waffle promises an authentic taste of breakfast bliss.</p>

                <li>Chocolate Waffle - $6.00</li>
                <img src="/Images/Chocolate-Waffle.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Indulge in our irresistible Chocolate Waffle, a heavenly creation that transforms the classic Belgian
                    waffle into a chocolate lover's dream. Each waffle is infused with rich cocoa powder and premium
                    dark chocolate chips, creating a deep, luxurious chocolate flavor that permeates every bite. The
                    exterior maintains that signature crispy texture while hiding a moist, fudgy interior that melts in
                    your mouth. Our special chocolate batter recipe ensures a perfect balance between cake-like softness
                    and traditional waffle crispiness. Topped with a dusting of cocoa powder and served with your choice
                    of chocolate sauce, whipped cream, or fresh berries, this decadent treat works beautifully as both a
                    breakfast indulgence or a sophisticated dessert.</p>

                    ingredients, creating the ideal foundation for a medley of hand-selected berries, sliced bananas,
                    and tropical fruits. Topped with a light drizzle of pure honey or maple syrup and a dollop of

                    natural sweetness of fresh fruits complements the warm, buttery waffle, creating a breakfast or
